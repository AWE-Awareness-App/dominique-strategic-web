# Welcome to My First Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in MDX. You can write **Markdown** and use React components!

## Here's a Subheading

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

```js
// You can even include code blocks
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, MDX!');
}
```

## Another Section

You can embed components directly in your MDX:

import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

<Button>Click me!</Button>

That's it for now. Happy blogging!
